          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The greater one’s income, the lower one’s likelihood of disease and premature death.
            1 Studies show that Americans at all income levels are less healthy than those with incomes higher than their own.
            2 Not only is income (the earnings and other money acquired each year) associated with better health, but wealth
            (net worth and assets) affects health as well.</p>

          <p>Though it is easy to imagine how health is tied to income for the very poor or the very rich, the relationship
            between income and health is a gradient: they are connected step-wise at every level of the economic ladder.
            Middle-class Americans are healthier than those living in or near poverty, but they are less healthy than
            the upper class. Even wealthy Americans are less healthy than those Americans with higher incomes.</p>

          <p>Income is a driving force behind the striking health disparities that many minorities experience. In fact,
            although blacks and Hispanics have higher rates of disease than non-Hispanic whites, these differences
            are “dwarfed by the disparities identified between high- and low-income populations within each racial/
            ethnic group.”
             That is, higher-income blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans have better health than
            members of their groups with less income, and this income gradient appears to be more strongly tied to
            health than their race or ethnicity</p>
